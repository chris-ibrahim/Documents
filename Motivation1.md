What are sensori-motor contingencies

Why are epistemic action non trivial? Didn't the previous model include action to obtain more information about the environment as part of a pragmatic action? Why isn't that the case?

This article [On Distinguishing Epistemic from Pragmatic Action](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15516709cog1804_1) in the second paragraph of the abstract, is the answer. Actually, a pragmatic action has to change the world, epistemic actions do not have any direct impact on the world.

# Thoughts

### The Phd subject
The first paragraph talks about what the work is about and the second one is the implications and goals. Besides, they are planning to work with this start up [hoomano](http://hoomano.com/en/?noredirect=en_US) but we don't exactly in what way they are going to perform it. The only clue we have is the fact that this company activities consist in integrating artificial intelligence in social robots, including pepper. 

Moreover the phd position would rather get someone who's ever worked with pepper. Therefore, we could wonder if the solution is going to be implemented to pepper, if it is some other robot. Thereby, you could already talk about. How they programm their pepper, whether it's using choregraph, from ros or directly with dedicated python and c++ api's.

As what I can see in these [slides](http://hoomano.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/FICHE_PRODUIT_FLEX_WORKER.pdf), in the 2nd page  on the + Hoomano chart, what they did ith pepper for they client look like pretty much what we did in our PGE with Ziggy for Eurecia. So you are going to have to talk about it to them, so they know that you already did quite a similar work

I was very impressed by it. I've never met someone at the interface of both disciplines psychology and artificial intelligence even though I knew that there were quite complementary.

Seeing your resume make want to ask you advises on how you mqnged to get there and if you exactly planned beforehand to do what you are currently doing because as of now, I am really interested on doing that, I don't know if I want to teach psychology but I sure would like to know as much as someone who'd be able to teach it

I don't know what kind of probabilities you study in statistics life science but does it have something to do with belief thoery and [probalistic logics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_logic)?

He studies AMAS just the way you like it.

Talks in the abstract about perceptual information modulated by actions. This artcile [Perceptual resonance: action-induced modulation of perception](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661307001520) sheds light on this concept by telling there is an bi-directional relationship between perception and action
