Qu'est ce que cette thèse repésente pour toi

What are sensori-motor contingencies

Why are epistemic action non trivial? Didn't the previous model include action to obtain more information about the environment as part of a pragmatic action? Why isn't that the case?

This article [On Distinguishing Epistemic from Pragmatic Action](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15516709cog1804_1) in the second paragraph of the abstract, is the answer. Actually, a pragmatic action has to change the world, epistemic actions do not have any direct impact on the world.

## The Phd subject : in the scope of [AMPLIFIER](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/mathieu.lefort/jobs/subject_M2_amplifier.pdf) project
I noticed that you did not talk much about the amplifier project. So I did some research on the internet and I found you project application.

The first paragraph talks about what the work is about and the second one is the implications, the outcomes and goals. In the second paragraph, it's said that machine learning is "often used with classical methods developped in computer vision and natural language processing,..." What kind of classical methods are they referring to? Moreover, there is a part when it says that the impact of the merging is still not well understood. What do they mean?

Besides, they are planning to work with this start up [hoomano](http://hoomano.com/en/?noredirect=en_US) but we don't exactly in what way they are going to perform it. The only clue we have is the fact that this company activities consist in integrating artificial intelligence in social robots, including pepper. 

Moreover the phd position would rather get someone who's ever worked with pepper. Therefore, we could wonder if the solution is going to be implemented to pepper, if it is some other robot. Thereby, you could already talk about. How they programm their pepper, whether it's using choregraph, from ros or directly with dedicated python and c++ api's.

As what I can see in these [slides](http://hoomano.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/FICHE_PRODUIT_FLEX_WORKER.pdf), in the 2nd page  on the + Hoomano chart, what they did with pepper for they client look like pretty much what we did in our PGE with Ziggy for Eurecia. So you are going to have to talk about it to them, so they know that you already did quite a similar work.

### Relation with your current intership
I've just realized that the activity detecton application proposed by Dr Lera is in fact multi-modal perception and merging where the sensory data are sound, images (emotion and object) and time. Try to talk about that with your recruiter because I think that will interest them a lot. The difference here is that it doesn't thoroughly  follow any psychological cognitivist paradygm.

### [Jean-Charles Quinton Curriculum](http://quintonj.free.fr/index.php/Main/Vita)
I was very impressed by it. I've never met someone at the interface of both disciplines psychology and artificial intelligence even though I knew that there were quite complementary.

Seeing your resume make want to ask you advises on how you mqnged to get there and if you exactly planned beforehand to do what you are currently doing because as of now, I am really interested on doing that, I don't know if I want to teach psychology but I sure would like to know as much as someone who'd be able to teach it

I don't know what kind of probabilities you study in statistics life science but does it have something to do with belief thoery and [probalistic logics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_logic)? Because I have a supervisor for a thesis a applied for which were studying it and I thought It was a very interesting domain as its about formalizing logic model.

And you also have some expertise in psychology, to what extent does the worked for this phd will be using results in neursciences and cognitive psychology. This is a part that is really interest me. +Talk about the papers on

### [A sensorimotor account of vision and visual consciousness](http://nivea.psycho.univ-paris5.fr/OREGAN-NOE-BBS/ORegan;Noe.BBS.pdf)[]
This work adresses as its title suggests, to what extent seeing can be considered as an action which allows an individual to navigate in an inner representation of the external world.

### [Action-dependent perceptual invariants: From ecological to sensorimotor approaches](http://nitens.org/docs/invariants_concog.pdf)[]
Talks in the abstract about perceptual information modulated by actions. This artcile [Perceptual resonance: action-induced modulation of perception](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661307001520) sheds light on this concept by telling there is an bi-directional relationship between perception and action
